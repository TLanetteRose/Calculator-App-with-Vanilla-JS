## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

I have included two screen shots of four devices: 
* Nexus 5 (360x640)
* Surface Duo (540x720)
* iPad (768x1024)
* Laptop (1280x950)

I used an awesome open-source devtool app called [Responsively](https://opencollective.com/responsively). It allowed me to see the calculator on different sized devices live while I was editing. You can inspect the code and take screen shots.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS framework

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Useful resources

I used a lot of references and resources to build this calculator. Although this was the second calculator that I have built, I was still a little unsure about the JavaScript I would need for the calculator function. I also wanted to learn how to code the three themes using Sass variables. 

- [Example resource 1](https://www.example.com) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
